  <p> I love dolphins!! Aside from my pets, dolphins are my favorite animal. <br> When I went to Florida in high school I visited Sea World and took this picture.<br> My family went to Cozumel, Mexico and I was able to swim with the dolphins there.</p>

  <p>A few years ago I went on a trip to South Africa with my sister.<br> I went on a 15 day safari and during that time I was able to capture amazing photos.<br> The craziest thing that happened on the trip was being charged by an elephant!</be></p>
